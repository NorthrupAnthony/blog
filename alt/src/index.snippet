Hello and welcome to my site!

All of this is created programmatically by a neat python script. It took about three days to perfect it but it now works like a charm.

Here's a link to the 
? /raw.html
original demo page
?
 I first typed up in raw HTML. It is now encoded in my .page format which I parsed and output using my python script to the 
? /Test/demo
new demo page
?
. Fancy, right?
